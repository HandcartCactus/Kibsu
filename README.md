# Kibsu
Kibsu is an experimental high-level HTML/XML scraping framework in Python that allows you to scrape with **real** semantics, not `divs` and classes. 
## Demo
Use Kibsu to [scrape senate press releases](kibsu_senate_scraper_demo.ipynb) off multiple different websites (with different classes and even tag structures!) without actually having to engage with html. Seriously. The XPath stuff is all abstracted away.

## Why?
Why write (and maintain) more than one scraper when you can fiddle with an added layer of abstraction and pray to god you never have to do any troubleshooting?

## Does it have any downsides?
Absoloutely. I haven't even written any tests yet.
